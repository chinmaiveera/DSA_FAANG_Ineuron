4.An almost sorted array is given to us and the task is to sort that array completely. Then,
which sorting algorithm would you prefer and why?
Ans. Insertion Sort
To know the reason let us look at its algorithm
To sort an array of size N in ascending order:
    • Iterate from arr[1] to arr[N] over the array.
    • Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor.
    • If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move  the greater elements one position up to make space 
    for the swapped element.
In the above algorithm we can clearly see that at every pass swapping and further comparisions are done only if the predecessor is not in order.
In almost sorted array there are very less elements that are not in order. So, therefore no unnessasary  swapping’s or comparisions.
